# Bad-Apple-Source
Bad apple implementation for source engine console 

Compilation and lauch instructions

1. Place the BadApple.cpp file somewhere in the client, add it to the .vpc file (eg client_hl2.vpc) and compile the project.
2. Place BadApple.txt in the scripts folder and place BadApple.wav in the sounds folder.
3. Launch the game and type badapple in the console to start the animation. (if it doesn't fit, try resizing the console)
4. To stop type badapple_stop command (It needs sv_cheats 1)

It works in hl2, maybe it'l work in other source games, but i don't guarantee it.
